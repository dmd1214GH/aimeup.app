Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-react".

(The package "eslint-plugin-react" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/Users/dougdanoff/code/aimeup/apps/eatgpt".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-react@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-react" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.cjs Â» ../../configs/eslint/react.cjs".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
