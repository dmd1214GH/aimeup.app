very well then.  This will be the next story.  Please review carefully and consider what might be done in preparation to make it go more smoothly:   **BL-0106 — Environment & configuration 
  baseline**
  [] Environment variables are validated at startup; invalid/missing values are surfaced clearly.
  [] Developer guide documents install, run, test, and environment setup end-to-end.
  [-] A KitchenSink screen renders core `@aimeup/ui-native` components without runtime warnings on native and web. 
  [-] Component smoke tests validate interactive basics using `@testing-library/react-native`.
  [-] Remove @ts-ignore comments from UI components after NativeWind is properly configured, and ensure TypeScript recognizes className props without errors.
  [-] Validate the state management additions from BL-0105 when UI controls are working

⏺ Review of BL-0106 and Preparation Recommendations

  Story Analysis

  This story focuses on:
  1. Environment setup (validation, documentation)
  2. Fixing NativeWind styling (carried over from BL-0105)
  3. Adding component tests (carried over from BL-0105)
  4. Cleaning up TypeScript workarounds

  Preparation to Make It Go Smoothly

  1. Research NativeWind v4 + Expo 53 Compatibility

  Before starting, we should:
  - Check if NativeWind v4 is actually compatible with Expo SDK 53
  - Look for working examples or GitHub issues
  - Consider alternatives:
    - Downgrade to NativeWind v2.0 (last stable for Expo)
    - Use styled-components or emotion instead
    - Use React Native's StyleSheet with a theme system

  2. Prepare Test Setup

  # Install testing dependencies now
  cd packages/ui-native
  pnpm add -D @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-native jest-expo

  3. Document Current Environment Variables

  Create a .env.example file now:
  # apps/eatgpt/.env.example
  # Add any env vars that will be needed
  API_URL=http://localhost:3000

  4. Create Validation Schema Structure

  // packages/core/env/schema.ts
  export const envSchema = {
    API_URL: { required: false, default: 'http://localhost:3000' },
    // Add more as needed
  }

  Recommended Approach Order

  1. Fix NativeWind first - Everything else depends on this
  2. Add component tests - Easier once components render properly
  3. Environment validation - Can be done independently
  4. Documentation - Best done after everything works

  Potential Blockers to Address Now

  1. NativeWind Alternative: If NativeWind v4 truly doesn't work with Expo 53, we need a Plan B ready:
  // Alternative: Theme-based StyleSheet
  const useStyles = (theme: Theme) => StyleSheet.create({
    button: {
      backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary,
      // ...
    }
  })
  2. Test Environment: Ensure Jest works with our monorepo:
  // packages/ui-native/jest.config.js
  module.exports = {
    preset: 'jest-expo',
    transformIgnorePatterns: [
      'node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|
  native-base|react-native-svg)'
    ]
  }
  3. Environment Validation: Consider using zod for schema validation:
  pnpm add zod

  Would you like me to create any of these preparatory files now?

⏺ NativeWind v4 + Expo SDK 53 Display Problem Statement

  The Issue

  className props on React Native components are not applying Tailwind styles in an Expo SDK 53 + NativeWind v4 monorepo setup

  Symptoms

  - Components render as unstyled text despite having className props with Tailwind classes
  - TypeScript doesn't recognize className as a valid prop on React Native components
  - Babel plugin errors: "BABEL is not a valid plugin" when trying to use nativewind/babel
  - Metro bundler hangs at 98-99% when CSS imports are enabled

  Environment

  - Expo SDK: 53.0.20
  - React Native: 0.79.5
  - NativeWind: 4.1.23
  - React: 19.0.0
  - Tailwind CSS: 3.4.17
  - Metro: 0.82.5 (via Expo)
  - Monorepo: pnpm workspaces with Turborepo
  - Node: 22.18.x

  What We've Tried

  1. ✅ Added withNativeWind to metro.config.js
  2. ✅ Created global.css with Tailwind directives
  3. ✅ Added nativewind preset to tailwind.config.js
  4. ❌ Using nativewind/babel plugin - causes "BABEL is not a valid plugin" error
  5. ❌ Using react-native-css-interop/babel - same error
  6. ❌ cssInterop() function calls - causes runtime errors
  7. ✅ Added shamefully-hoist=true to .npmrc for React Native deps

  Current Workarounds

  - Removed CSS import to prevent bundler hanging
  - Added @ts-ignore to all className props
  - Components functional but unstyled
