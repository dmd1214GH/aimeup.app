Please do #1 broader analysis just to make sure we have what we need. Also, let me know the best way to get you access to the
kotlin code. There is not very much. We should also talk about the best way to sequence the code conversion work. This is only
specified at the package level currently.

⏺ Phase 1-2 Analysis

Looking at the conversion plan, I see potential issues and gaps:

Phase 1 Technical Issues:
[] BL-0105: Mentions Redux Toolkit + TanStack Query together - this could be redundant/conflicting. TanStack Query handles server
state, RTK handles client state, but the integration pattern needs clarity.
[] BL-0107: Tokens pipeline depends on design token tooling not yet specified. Need to define the token format and build process
before BL-0105 UI work.
[] BL-0115: KitchenSink references @aimeup/ui-native components that don't exist yet - this creates a circular dependency with
BL-0105.

Phase 2 Sequencing Issues:
[] BL-0108: Core domain port needs Kotlin source analysis first - we can't port models without seeing the originals.
[] BL-0110: OpenAI contracts should potentially come before BL-0119 (Android shell) since the shell needs to use these contracts.
[] BL-0119: "minimal temporary UI" is vague - needs more specific acceptance criteria.

Missing Dependencies:
[] No BL item for @aimeup/core-react package creation (referenced in BL-0105)
[] Token generation tooling unspecified but required for BL-0107

[] No clear specification of what Kotlin models/types need porting

Code Conversion Sequencing Strategy

Recommended approach:

1. Foundation-first: Types, schemas, core contracts
2. Domain-by-domain: Complete one domain (e.g., chat) end-to-end before starting another
3. Layer-by-layer within domains: Models → Services → ViewModels → UI components

⏺ For analyzing the Kotlin codebase, copying it into a folder in this repo would be the most efficient approach. This gives me direct
access to analyze the structure, dependencies, and code patterns.

What works better for you - copying the Kotlin project into \_reference/kotlin-original/ or another approach?

Yes, a file listing mapping to BL items would be extremely helpful! This would create a clear conversion roadmap and prevent scope
creep.

⏺ Excellent! I can see the modular structure aligns well with our planned TypeScript packages. The Kotlin modules map nicely to our
monorepo:

Kotlin → TypeScript Mapping:

- shared/ → packages/core/ (aiapi, chatapi, menuapi, securityapi)
- shared/utilities → packages/helpers/utility
- account/ → packages/account/
- chat/ → packages/chat/
- openai/ → packages/helpers/openai
- healthconnect/ → packages/eatgpt/healthconnect/
- nutritionProfile/ → packages/eatgpt/nutrition/
- app/ → apps/eatgpt/

For the file listing per BL item, I'd suggest organizing it like:

## BL-0108 — Core domain port

**Kotlin files to convert:**

- `shared/aiapi/*.kt` → `packages/core/aiapi/`
- `shared/chatapi/*.kt` → `packages/core/chatapi/`
- `shared/securityapi/*.kt` → `packages/core/securityapi/`
- `shared/menuapi/*.kt` → `packages/core/menuapi/`
- `shared/utilities/*.kt` → `packages/helpers/utility/`

**BL-0110 — OpenAI contracts**

- `openai/model/*.kt` → `packages/core/aiapi/`
- `shared/aiapi/AiServiceInterface.kt` → `packages/core/aiapi/`

This would help us:

1. Scope each BL precisely - know exactly what files we're converting
2. Track progress systematically - check off files as converted
3. Avoid scope creep - clear boundaries for each work item
4. Plan dependencies better - see what needs to come first

Would you like to create this file mapping, or should I draft one based on my analysis of the codebase structure?

> I will do it and answer your questions. I come back when everything is ready.

⏺ Perfect! That sounds like the right approach.

When you come back with:

1. File mapping per BL item - clear conversion scope for each work package
2. Answers to the technical questions I raised about Phase 1-2 (Redux+TanStack Query integration, token pipeline, missing
   dependencies, etc.)
3. Refined plan addressing any gaps or sequencing issues

We'll be in great shape to tackle BL-0105 and beyond systematically. The Kotlin codebase structure looks clean and well-organized,
so the conversion should be straightforward once we have the roadmap locked down.

See you when everything's ready!
