# React + TypeScript Standards

## Code Style & Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React 19 patterns and hooks
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Architecture Guidelines
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Maintain separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data

## Component Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when needed
- Implement proper error boundaries for error handling

## State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Prefer useState and useReducer for complex state
- Use Context API for shared state when appropriate
- Keep state as local as possible

## Performance Best Practices
- Use proper memoization techniques (useMemo, useCallback)
- Minimize re-renders
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Use React DevTools Profiler for performance analysis
