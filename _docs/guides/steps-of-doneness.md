# Steps of Doneness
These steps implicitly apply to every user story that touches code.  DO NOT [X] THESE WHEN DONE
[] aime.hygiene script runs without warnings or errors locally
[] aime.unittest script runs without errors
[] standard docs (in the guides folder) are updated if anything was changed by the story
[] update each BL-XXXX acceptance criteria to replace [] with either [X] if completed or [-] if not completed. Do not update the Doneness entries.
[] Changes committed to github and pushed to `origin main` after hygiene & tests pass and status is updated
