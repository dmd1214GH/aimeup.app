# Steps of Doneness

These steps implicitly apply to every backlog item that touches code. These are developer or agent affirmations of the completed work

- All work products comply with standards defined in `_docs/guides/development-standards.md` -- especially including the Development Quality Check as defined there
- New or removed packages are properly documented according to the standards in `_docs/guides/monorepo.md`
- Status is reported accurately, including task list status and written confirmations.
- Unresolved issues found during the Code & Test phase have been clearly reported and responded to, closing the loop.
- All acceptance criteria can be demonstrated in some way to a human
- Monorepo is ready to be committed by the human partner
