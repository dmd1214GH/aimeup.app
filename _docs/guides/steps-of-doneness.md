# Steps of Doneness
These steps implicitly apply to every user story that touches code.  DO NOT [X] THESE WHEN DONE
[] _scripts/aimequal includes tests from this story and all prior ones, and runs without warnings or errors against a merged code set
[] standard docs (in the guides folder) are updated if anything was changed by the story
[] a clear showcase plan has been presented to the developer (including support if necessary) so results can be validated before committing changes.  Plan includes instructions for checking in if all tests pass
[] AI should NOT commit code
