# Steps of Doneness

These steps implicitly apply to every backlog item that touches code. These are developer or agent affirmations of the completed work

1. All work products comply with standards defined in `_docs/guides/development-standards.md` -- especially including the Development Quality Check as defined there
2. Status is reported accurately, including task list status and written confirmations.
3. Unresolved issues found during the Code & Test phase have been clearly reported and responded to, closing the loop.
4. All acceptance criteria can be demonstrated in some way to a human
5. Monorepo is ready to be committed by the human partner
